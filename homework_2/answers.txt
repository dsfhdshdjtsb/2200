Question 1
------------------------------------------
// TODO: Answer question 1 from the HW pdf

lea $ra, NEXT
BEQ $zero, $zero, <target>
NEXT

JALR does two things. First it sets $ra to the incremented program counter. the label NEXT is on the line 
immedietly following my JALR replacement, so it represents the incremented PC and will function the same. 
JALR's next functionality is to set PC to some address <target>, which can be accomplished by using BEQ with
a truthy comparison.

==========================================
Question 2
------------------------------------------
The division of responsiblity saves memory accesses. The caller is able to assume that the s registers are untouched,
therefore the caller does not have to waste memory ops on saving and restoring the s registers. Similarly, the t registers
can be assumed to be untouched by the callee, which also saves operations. If the caller needs to use the t registers, or the 
callee needs to use the s registers, then they can optionally choose to use them by handling the saving/restoration.
